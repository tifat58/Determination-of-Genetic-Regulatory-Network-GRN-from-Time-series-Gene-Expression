# Determination-of-Genetic-Regulatory-Network-GRN-from-Time-series-Gene-Expression

The entire work was divided into two phases, Data Reduction and Network Formation. 
During data reduction phase, genes having most contribution in bacterial growth in different time state  was found out based on Fidelity matrix approach
and During Network formation a genetic network was formed based on the interactions and dependencies among those genes.
